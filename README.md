# Flower Prediction using Iris Dataset

This project focuses on predicting the species of flowers using the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classical dataset in the machine learning community, used for classification tasks with the goal of predicting species of iris plants.

## Description

The script provided includes the following parts:

- **Part 1: Data Analysis**
  - Loading the Iris dataset.
  - Data cleaning including handling missing values and duplicates.
  - Checking for a balanced dataset.

- **Part 2: Machine Learning with Decision Trees**
  - Preparing features and target variables.
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
  - Training a Decision Tree Classifier.
  - Making predictions and evaluating model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
  - Displaying a classification report.

- **Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Visualizing the distribution of species using count plots.
  - Creating histograms for each feature in the dataset.
  - Generating scatter plots to examine the relationship between sepal and petal dimensions.
  - Creating box plots to visualize the distribution of each feature by species.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Rich

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed and the necessary libraries.
2. Place the Iris.csv file in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script to perform data analysis, train the model, and visualize the data.
